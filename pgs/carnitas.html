    <H3>Ingredients</H3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds boneless pork shoulder (or pork butt), cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 oranges, juiced (about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <H3>Recipe</H3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Season the Pork</strong>
            <p><ul>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the pork cubes, chopped onion, minced garlic, cumin, oregano, chili powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to evenly coat the pork with the seasonings.</li>
                
            </ul></p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Marinate the Pork</strong>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Add the bay leaves, freshly squeezed orange juice, lime juice, and chicken broth to the seasoned pork mixture. Mix to combine. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, but overnight marinating is even better.</li>
            </ul></p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Cook the Pork</strong>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Heat a large, heavy-bottomed skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the vegetable oil. Once the oil is hot, add the marinated pork and sear it until it's browned on all sides.</li>
            </ul></p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Simmer the Pork</strong>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet or Dutch oven, and let the pork simmer for about 2-3 hours or until it becomes tender. You can also transfer the mixture to an oven-safe dish and cook it in the oven at 325°F (163°C) for a similar amount of time. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
                
            </ul></p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Shred and Serve</strong>
            <p><ul>
                <li>Once the pork is tender and can be easily shredded with a fork, remove it from the heat. Shred the pork into smaller pieces. You can crisp it up by placing it under a broiler for a few minutes if you like. Serve the pork carnitas in warm corn tortillas with your choice of salsa, chopped cilantro, diced onions, and lime wedges.</li>
            </ul></p>
        
        </li>

    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy your homemade pork carnitas!</p>
